      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blake Cole received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the &lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/strong&gt;.  He was part of the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, and was coadvised by Dr. Peter Traykovski and Prof. Henrik Schmidt.  While at MIT, Blake developed a first-of-its-kind design optimization methodology for aerodynamically-actuated wingsails, and validated his approach using a bespoke in-situ data aquisition rig called the &lt;em&gt;WingDAQ&lt;/em&gt;.  He also made meaningful contributions to the field of marine vehicle autonomy, including a novel instantiation of the unscented Kalman filter that is particularly well-suited to long-distance vessel tracking and collision avoidance.  Moving forward, Blake remains interested in designing, building, and testing new types of uncrewed surface vehicles and flying machines.&lt;/p&gt;
